we read and watch thrilling, action-packed adventures all the time, but you may notice how unrealistic it all is. louisa may alcott has accomplished what was thought to be impossible – a realistic yet entertaining story – in her book, little men. it is a book full of wondrous adventures and stories; it feels more natural compared to other books that were designed only to be entertaining. written in 1871, it is absolutely a masterpiece of modern literature. little men is wonderfully written, very fun, and thought-provoking all the way through. the author makes use of wonderful writing techniques, even going as far as to tell the story from the point of view of a tree! i found this story to be great and entertaining, and i hope you do too. a superb part of the story is when nat is charged with the theft of tommy's money. suspense, suspicion, surprising developments, and an even more surprising conclusion all work together to make this story one of the best in the book. "'now, my son, give me an honest answer. did you take the money?' 'no sir!' and nat looked up at him imploringly." this part of the story is very fun and unparalleled in terms of shocking endings. i won't spoil the story for you, but i will say, it's very surprising.
