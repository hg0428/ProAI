here is a short peice of a story i wrote: 
where he was going didn't matter, he was leaving, and that's all that mattered to him. he continued roughly north for a few miles before taking a break. he sat down on a grassy area beside the road; the grass was soft and felt good. he took out the bread he had packed and broke a piece off. the bread was soft and delicious; it reminded him of home. while sitting, he noticed a group of trees off in a distant field. half of them were dead, yet the other half were tall and thriving. it puzzled him. how can the good be mixed with the bad? how can failure be mixed with success? the clouds drifted overhead; the sun sank toward the horizon. before he knew it, it was dark. he had been sitting for hours. "well, i best get some sleep," he thought. when he awoke, it was morning; the soft grass had been like a bed to him. he had slept well. after a quick bite of bread, he started off on his journey again, continuing north. he had no map and no idea where this road would take him.
