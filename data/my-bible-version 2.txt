In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth. The Earth was formless and empty, darkness covered the waters, and the spirit of God hovered over the surface of the water.
	Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. Then God divided the light from the darkness. The light he called "Day," and the darkness he called "Night." And there was evening, and there was morning, the first day.
	Then God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters." And God fashioned the expanse and divided the waters, and God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening, and there was morning, the second day.
	Then God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so. God called the dry land "earth" and the waters he called "Ocean." God saw that it was good.
	Then God said, "Let the Earth sprout forth vegetation â€” seed-bearing plants and trees yielding seed-bearing fruit, and let the seeds bring forth plants alike to those from which they came." And it was so. The Earth brought forth plants and trees just as God had commanded, and God saw that it was good. So there was evening, and there was morning, the third day.
